Autels;
A-TUTO1;"On this day, we had lost everything. After fleeing to the woods, we had nothing but regrets. The old chief quickly gathered the survivors and led us towards a haven, an odd grotto buried beneath the trees. From there, we could see the smoke still rising from our previous homes, and we could hear the screams rising from the village. We had lost fights, but we never had lost war. We spent the night counting the dead and tending the wounded. On the morning, The chief surprised everyone: “we shall not take revenge on thee.” He preached about pacifism, about turning the pages: “We have lived in an era of violence, of carnage and rapes. What we lived yesterday is what we have been inflicting to our enemies. It is time for us to learn from our mistakes, and to evolve. The roots of our new civilization need to be love, empathy, and understanding."""
A-TUTO2;The masks became a part of the everyday life. When somebody needed to take a decision, to act as a role but not as a person, we crafted precious little masks, tokens of our will to change and to be freed of the violence. When we first settled in the forest, our hearts were filled with anger and resentment. The first decisions led in savage crimes. Eolius' brother, who preached repentance and redemption, had been found gutted down and hanging on a tree. Eolius quickly advocated for the creation of masks, a way to defend ourselves against our own violence, to cast it away. A simple symbol worn to channel blood pulsions. And for those who weren't satisfied, departure was the only option: this is how we suffered even more loss, when our brothers and sisters left because they didn't share our ethics, our way to think. They quickly became known as the astray.
A-J1;Never shall we resolve conflicts with violence again! Never shall we draw our brothers and sisters’ blood! This is what nature taught us, this is what we must seek, this is what our civilization will be. The forest gave us the space and time to meditate, the war made us pay for our crimes. Now that we have faced the sorrowful mourning and the death of loved ones, we are finally evolving. Harbored by a green halo, many of us are finding the strength to forgive, and the will to break free from savagery. But amongst us was raised the question : are we ready to leave ? Can we face what's outside ?
A-J2;"First, we made sure everyone would be able to agree or disagree with a statement, a law, a rule. Then, we made sure that nobody could be able to take advantage from anyone else. Lastly, we sheltered ourselves behind masks. The days of violence were behind us, but we feared that any of us would go against his own brother or sister. Henceforth, masks shall be used when performing rites, ceremonies that involve judgement or harsh measures, so that any retaliation would be impossible. This is through these changes that we evolved; this is what kept us on the right path."
A-D1;"Behind the mountains of the east lies the great emptiness. 
Miles and miles of what seem like eternal snow covers the region. Tempests frequently block the way, making movement a difficult and exhausting task, as well as disorienting our guides. Due to frequently losing our path, we would have to retreat every time we came. However, that changed when Pyxis, with their great knowledge of the stars and our world’s laws, found a way to hold our direction: the compass. New travels through the great emptiness were then conducted, leading to the discovery of the northern lights hills. There, the tapestry of the sky is replete with colourful, moving waves that seem like sparks suspended in the air. Ever since we discovered this place, we came back every year to admire the view and celebrate our new conquests."
A-D2;The saltless sea divides in three rivers. We used to join it through one of these water branches, especially the south one, where the shield-headed used to live. The water is calm, and surrounded by a forest of thick trees, allowing for easy and discreet travel. Called the silver path, the river is also rich with fish, boarded with mushrooms and populated by rainbow birds. Once arriving to the saltless sea, we would decorate our capes, crowns and swords with their feathers, light up a huge fire and dance on the golden sand. The sun, setting on the blood-coloured horizon, would lit the way for our next travels. And despite the capricious nature of the sea, nothing was unconquerable to us.
A-JJ1;O, blooded mother, How serene we sang your songs while sweeping with swords the spines of our enemies ! How happily we were after kidnapping men and women, gutting them and torturing them as rites for our delights ! Why were we that cruel, that sanguine, and desperate for violence ? Because we had always been ! This is what we kept repeating ourselves while slashing, because it was easier to admit than to confront. But after a decade in the forest, we started changing. Some called it a cleansing, but there is nothing religious in this : we grew differently, we started discovering a new way of thinking and of communicating.
A-JJ2;Fireflies happily dancing around our children as they gather mushrooms for the evening meal. Masks are getting more and more forgotten, as they are hanged inside houses, or sometimes on trees. We overcame the hardest part of our recreation, finally did it. No longer do we have to fear retaliation, no longer will blood be shed amongst us. Our newest generations have transcended our beliefs, our hopes, and have became a better version of ourselves. And we owe it to this place, this sanctuary, that allowed us the deconstruct our myths and roots. Rise up, friends, and bathe in the light that emanates from our heart: this is love, and this is how we shall live forever.
A-JD1;One day, one of the astray came back, wounded and wearing significant scars on his face. His right arm was missing, and as he crawled near our homes, he cried for help. We immediately took care of him and gave him a warm bed in one of our huts, where we have been able to ease his pain. But a mere question was lying in everyone’s mind: could we keep him in our tribe? Could we allow one who made the choice of violence, of not evolving, to stay among us? Because everyone feared one thing: that leaving the forest had been a good choice. That violence was a solution. What to do with the astray?
A-JD2;Endless debates ensued. Some of us were so relieved to see one of us back from the dangerous outside that they did not want to let go of them. Some others were more skeptical and feared a return to form. To solve the issue, we created the mask of concertation. It was built to find an objective solution to our problem. Or at least, the one that would be the more suited to our survival and growth alike. One of our members wore the mask and, individually, concerted the two sides. Afterwards, they were gone, wandering in the forest, pondering the situation. They did not come back before weeks, but eventually expressed their judgement, indicating that they had to seek through the deepest of their own soul to find the answer.
A-DD1;Our wooden boats, graceful, long, narrow and light, would pierce the sea and follow the wind with ease. To facilitate navigation, we would build them symmetrical : this way, it was easy to reverse direction quickly and navigate through the ice seas. The travels were made much easier, and one could contemplate the northern gentle colors shying away in the distance. Despite being lightweight, the boats could carry lots of marchandise. Thus, we were able to transport lots of food and survive harsh, long travels. But the practical aspect of the ship wasn't the most impressive. Ornated with tons of pieces varying from stones, animal totems, feathers or leafs, the ship were heavy in decoration and carried all our hopes and dreams with them.
A-DD2;Beyond the great sea are settlements of our people. There, animals with huge horns and thick fur inhabit vast, green meadows like we had never seen before. Gigantic clouds roam through the sky, sometimes accompanied by opaque rain hazes. Cohabitting with the sun and moon are trees which branches don't let a single spot of light pierce through their leaves. They make for great cover when stormy rains flood the plains. So this is where most of us live, as the trees also provide woods,  plants and host many animals. The villages are organized in floors, built on wooden planks fixed to the tree's trunk.  The wind is stronger on the higher floors, but it is the only place where you can gaze at the large, mystic forest that looms on the horizon. At night, you can even see multiple yellow lights blinking.
A-DJ1;Our first encounter with the thick-furred strangers of the meadows was but a quickly shared eye-contact. It was reported by a group of gatherers who went close to the forest's vicinity. They went back to the village quickly, carrying a sense of suspicion on their backs. Very soon, a troop of spear and axe-geared soldiers were on their way to find the strangers' village. Singing on their way, their voices mixed with the sound of the weapons and carriages. When they came back, they brought back the fur of the strangers with traces of blood all over. On their faces were traditional blood paintings, as a commemoration to winning the battle.  The next day, a second trip was planned, and a bigger troop was sent. They never came back.
A-DJ2;But the bigger troop never came back. Confused, we started being concerned about the fate of our friends we sent forward. Hardly ever have we met loss and defeat, so this situation was new to us. What to do then ? Worried, we packed our weapons and thought about our brothers and sisters. What if they never came back ? What if we had to fight without them tomorrow ? As the sun was setting, we lied in wait, a huge forest lying behind our small village. The next morning, we started hearing sounds of footsteps, of iron carriage clinking, and the smell of blood rose in the air. But our eyes didn't meet our friends, only the sharp arrows of the retalation.
Septimus;
S-TUTO1;"I’m glad you get to talk to me first, Choicemaker.; I am Septimus, the appointed leader of our community.; You have been chosen as the only one able to do the right choice.; Years have passed since we started living in the forest,; recreating a society where violence is forbidden,; but now we face a hiatus: are we ready, or not, to leave the forest?; I think we still need to atone for our mistakes:; Violence is part of our genome, and we can hardly erase it from our behaviors.; Skip throughs the woods, and think carefully, Choicemaker.; Do not stray from the right path."
S-TUTO2;"We meet again, Choicemaker.; You probably had the opportunities to discover the root of our society and its flaws.; I am the direct descendant of Eolius, the last leader of our community.; While we became a better community and better human beings,; we learnt how to create a new history and develop new roots.; But one must pay attention; and grasp what our ancestors suffered and how we must move from it.; It is only by remaining longer in the forest that; we can take the time to fully understand.; What lies outside of these woods other than the consequences of our actions?; Are we prepared yet to face those?; This is your move, ChoiceMaker.; Do not destroy the content of our efforts,; do not try to leave this holy place."
S-J;"Choicemaker, what a delight to hear from you again.; I assume you are now prepared to make the significant choice that we all expect.; And I can sense the resolve in your eyes,; your will to put an end to our doubts and wondering.; What is the point of leaving after so many good years?; What is the point of making the same mistake again?; We all know what will happen:; our people shall leave the forest,; get humiliated or violented once outside,; and our savagery shall be renewed:; we will slay, rape, torture those who oppose themselves to us.; Discoveries can be made, but inside ourselves:; we do not need to see the outside world,; we need to explore our inner mantras.; Let’s dive deeper in the forest.; Let’s dive deeper into our heart.; Take the path of atonement; and let us take more time to understand who we really are.;"
S-D;"Come along, Choicemaker, and tag along with me in the woods.; Ignis would love you to believe that leaving the forest is the right choice,; and that we are now prepared for what's lying outside.; Don't let these ideas cloud your mind, as they are wrong and insidious.; What good is it to waste our time in the forest, he might say ?; But what good to waste our time leaving the forest; and stopping everything we have been working for, I say ?; I put my faith in you, my friend.; You are the only one who can work this out.; Is there anything more to say than ask for mere rationality ?; Don't let us become what we despise, what we sworn to destroy."
S-JJ;"This is it, Choicemaker.; I believe you made the right decision.; What’s good in wasting the lives of our people?; Why should we leave this haven where we grow in the right way?; You have spoken; and your words shall be the delicate caress of love that soothe us.; Now, leave your mask,; be freed of your responsibility,; let us explore the depths of the forest,; and the depths of our heart."
S-JD;"So it is then, choicemaker.; Did Ignis have anything to do with your decision ?; This isn’t how you are supposed to solve this conflict.; But I guess you can give it a try.; Nothing great lies beyond these trees; and what if you meet tribes we mutilated ?; What if you encounter the very same people we murdered decades ago ?; Do you think this is the right decision, choicemaker ?; If so, go on, and bring us good news.; You will tell us.; What is right, and what is wrong,; if we did the right  choice, or not.; Leave now, Choicemaker,; and keep your mask as the symbol of your quest for truth."
S-DJ;"Choicemaker, is this really what you want?; To break free from your responsibility?; From your role?; Don’t you want to play along and be the one you are supposed to be; the liberator of this nonsense?; Then if that’s your choice,; turmoil shall begin anew,; and conflicts shall rise again.; You have been tasked to help us,; and you failed us all.; Are you that happy with this decision?; Because I think you could have been doing things otherwise."
Ignis;
I-TUTO1;"Greetings, Choicemaker. My name is Ignis.; As you can see, I bear the mask of freedom,; inspired by our ancestors' desire to explore the world.; And now this desire is ours again.; Indeed, the forest has soothed us,; healed our wounds and inspired us a newfound pacifism,; your mask is the very proof of that.; But we can not stay here forever,; we have compensated enough for the crimes of the ancients.; We have learned from history; and I believe we are mature enough to breath the air outside the forest again.; And so are you, choicemaker.; I trust you on believing in our people; and making the right choice to guide us forward."
I-TUTO2;"Hello again, Choicemaker.; It seems you get to hear from me again.; Have you been learning about the ancient ones on your path here ?;  I have been passing our history onto; the younger and older generations alike for years now.; Some fear this very history,; invoking the awakening of old-fashioned pulsions.; Do not listen to them.; As long as you read it with your heart and spirit,; history can only make you wiser.; If you close your eyes on history,; you'll end up blind.; But if you open them, you'll discover plenty of wonders.; Follow the impulse of curiosity, Choicemaker.; Do not be afraid,; let it guide you and open up the path to the treasure of our ancestors ! "
I-J;"I've overheard your last conversation with Septimus,; back were the moon stood.; It pains me to hear how Septimus invokes; their ancestor to preach about the holiness of the forest.; Eolius was a visionary,; they led the path forward with their pacifist ethos.; But what Septimus seems to be forgetting is that; Eolius went in full contradiction with the ancient gods and traditions.; Our new history is one of breaking with the tradition; as well as breaking new ground.; We need to evolve, choicemaker.; Our real problem was our lack of self-questionning.; That said, I think you talking to me is; the proof you are lucid and understand our history.; Although some of us seem afraid of our past and going outside,; we need to keep evolving,; and leaving this place is the only way."
I-D;"Choicemaker, I can see the sparkles in your eyes.; I assume that, if you have gone to me again,; it means we share the same burning desire to; explore the world outside of the forest.; Can you feel this fire inside of you ?; Not one of conquest,; but one of learning more and beyond !; And if we were to make mistakes again,; then so be it.; Just like we learned from the great massacre,; we will learn again.; It is only unfair to us; new generations of the forest; that we be imprisoned in the woods for the barbary of our ancestors !; I do not want to be haunted by them anymore,; I want to clear a new path for us.; And this path leads outside of the borders of the forest.; Cross it and the outside world is ours to discover.
"
I-JD;"You want to go outside alone, you say ?; Well, it seems we're in a deadlock.; Septimus' like-mindeds will never agree to go out of the forest.; So, choicemaker,; come back rich with landscapes in your mind,; goods in your pockets; and show them what we are missing.; I wish I could come with you,; but I would then be accused of corruption.; Therefore, I will patiently wait for your return.; And dream of the outside world."
I-DJ;"Breaking the mask like this ?; You sure are a bold one !; But as much as I respect your audacity, choicemaker…; What the hell do you think you're doing ?; You can't just escape your role like this !; Don't you want our people to go forward ?; Did Septimus contaminate you with their fear ?; I guess it became too much to bear; the responsibility of the choicemaker...; I am at lost now.; What are we to do ? "
I-DD;"The choicemaker has spoken,; and rejoiced the voice of exploration.; Thus, we shall retrace our ancestors' steps,; growing the seeds of peace on the way they once; tainted with bloodshed.; But do not look down on those,; and,; rather,; look up to the luminous skies that will; open up to us on the way.; Admire the silver, gold and manifold colours that will; shine before us,; and let them fill your heart,; as today we are writing a new page of history.; For the first time in centuries,; we are leaving the forest,; and the fire that guides us will mirror the sun :; enlightened and benevolent."
