A-TUTO1;On this day, we had lost everything. After fleeing to the woods, we had nothing but regrets. The old chief quickly gathered the survivors and led us towards a haven, an odd grotto buried beneath the trees. From there, we could see the smoke still rising from our previous homes, and we could hear the screams rising from the village. We had lost fights, but we never had lost war. We spent the night counting the dead and tending the wounded. On the morning, The chief surprised everyone: “we shall not take revenge on thee.” He preached about pacifism, about turning the pages: “We have lived in an era of violence, of carnage and rapes. What we lived yesterday is what we have been inflicting to our enemies. It is time for us to learn from our mistakes, and to evolve. The roots of our new civilization need to be love, empathy, and understanding.

Miles and miles of what seem like eternal snow covers the region. Tempests frequently block the way, making movement a difficult and exhausting task, as well as disorienting our guides. Due to frequently losing our path, we would have to retreat every time we came. However, that changed when Pyxis, with their great knowledge of the stars and our world’s laws, found a way to hold our direction: the compass. New travels through the great emptiness were then conducted, leading to the discovery of the northern lights hills. There, the tapestry of the sky is replete with colourful, moving waves that seem like sparks suspended in the air. Ever since we discovered this place, we came back every year to admire the view and celebrate our new conquests."
A-D2;The saltless sea divides in three rivers. We used to join it through one of these water branches, especially the south one, where the shield-headed used to live. The water is calm, and surrounded by a forest of thick trees, allowing for easy and discreet travel. Called the silver path, the river is also rich with fish, boarded with mushrooms and populated by rainbow birds. Once arriving to the saltless sea, we would decorate our capes, crowns and swords with their feathers, light up a huge fire and dance on the golden sand. The sun, setting on the blood-coloured horizon, would lit the way for our next travels. And despite the capricious nature of the sea, nothing was unconquerable to us.

I am Septimus, the appointed leader of our community. ; You have been chosen as the only one able to do the right choice. ; Years have passed since we started living in the forest, recreating a society where violence is forbidden, ; but now we face a hiatus: are we ready, or not, to leave the forest? I think we still need to atone for our mistakes: ; violence is part of our genome, and we can hardly erase it from our behaviors. ; Skip throughs the woods, and think carefully, Choicemaker. Do not stray from the right path."

I-TUTO1;"Greetings, Choicemaker. My name is Ignis.; As you can see, I bear the mask of freedom, a token of our ancestors' desire to explore the world.; And now this desire is ours again.; Indeed, the forest has soothed us, healed our wounds and inspired us a newfound pacifism,; your mask is the very proof of that.; We can not stay here forever, we have suffered enough for the crimes of the ancients.; We have learned from history and I believe we are mature enough to breath the air outside the forest again.; And so are you, choicemaker.; I trust you on believing in our people and making the right choice to guide us forward."
I-TUTO2;"Hello again, Choicemaker. It seems you get to hear from me again.; Have you been learning about the ancient ones on your path here ?;  I have been passing our history onto the younger and older generations alike for years now.; Some fear this very history, invoking the awakening of old-fashioned pulsions.; Do not listen to them, as long as you read it with your heart and spirit, history can only make you wiser.; If you close your eyes on history, you'll end up blind.; But if you open them, you'll discover plenty of wonders.; Follow the impulse of curiosity, Choicemaker.; Do not be afraid, let it guide you and open up the path to the treasure of our ancestors ! "
I-J;
I-D;"Choicemaker, I can see the sparkles in your eyes.; I assume that, if you have gone to me again, it means we share the same burning desire to explore the world outside of the forest.; Can you feel this fire inside of you ?; Not one of conquest,; but one to learn more a+J21nd beyond !; And if we were to make mistakes again, then so be it.; Just like we learned from the great massacre, we will learn again.; It is only unfair to us new generations of the forest that we be imprisoned in the woods for the barbary of our ancestors.; I do not want to be haunted by them anymore, I want to clear a new path for us.; This path leads outside of the borders of the forest.; Cross it and the outside world is ours to discover.
"

I-DD;"The choicemaker has spoken, and rejoiced the voice of exploration.; Thus, we shall retrace our ancestors' steps, growing the seeds of peace on the way they once tainted with bloodshed.; But do not look down on those, and, rather, look up to the luminous skies that will open up to us on the way.; Admire the silver, gold and manifold colours that will shine before us,; and let them fill your heart, as today we are writing a new page of history.; For the first time in centuries, we are leaving the forest,; and the fire that guides us will mirror the sun : enlightened and benevolent."
